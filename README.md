I made the website accessible for people with disabillities who use screen readers.
I made alternative texts for the images so people who can't access the image and need a 
worded discription are able to understand what they're reading better.
I created a more discriptive title for the webpage to ensure the website is optimized
for search engines. I did this so that people searching the internet and who are looking for 
similar content and services will be directed to this website. Making the title 
discriptive means that potential customers are able to find
what they're looking for faster so that the company gets higher traffic on their 
website. This means that the number of potential customers increases and
the company that I'm code refractoring for can then make more money.
